__When you run the Administrator addition, we see the main page of this supplement:__

```
On the left we can see the main panel that displays all the forms with which we can interact - adding
a product, such as the addition to the products, the addition of a parameter type, and also to add value
to the parameter, depending on the product.
```
**In the middle, we can see two panes.**

``` The first is responsible for adding, deleting, editing product. There is also the possibility of moving between the forms, using the navigation menu.``` 

``` In the second we can see a list of products that have already been added to the database.```
